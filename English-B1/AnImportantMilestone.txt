I have had the chance of change my life since I work

This have had given me economic independence of my parents and the possibility to organizate my own life.

In 1999 (one thousand nine hundred ninety-nine), I had chance to work in my city for the first time and I had to use my own money for to buy clothes, and
things that I used at University when I had studied and something more.
Since I work I have had payed vacations and I hadn´t ask for money to my parents.
In the second important work had a other milestone because I buyed a car and can traveling without paying.
At the moment I conserve the car and have thought change for other new.
The economic situation in my country is difficult for buys a car, an apartment, food and combustible, my parents
are retired and sometimes needs money to buy food or pay taxes and they ask me.
Other milestone was have had started to study English this year in Edutin Academy: I need know English because
in the career of Data Science is necesary.
