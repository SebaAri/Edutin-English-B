Today I앐 talking to you about a boy압 solidaritie, Ale. Ale a boy who on 2019 (Two thousand and nineteen) with 11
 (Eleven) years old, made a community dinning room in Villa Caracol neighbohood for his friends.The Ale압 mother 
who cooked rice for the children, when made habitual, make a community dinning room in her house called "Los Amigos".

At 5:00 P.M.about 25 (Twenty five) boys arrived to the community dinning room for enjoy a snack.Sometimes is 
necessary that people support the cause and make a donation.

The mother압 Ale: Elba Esther Carreras feel unhappy when arrive children but happiness for help them. 
The neighborhood is poor and haven앖 a services as sewers and gas, nor even have a asphalt on the streets, so when
is necessary an ambulance many times don앖 get in the neighborhood either.

They come out to ask for bread in a backeries and buy jam. All the children should been have a meal and the 
mother압 Ale is doing this to protec children압 right.
Tere are others communities dinning room to give the people for lunch and dinner but they are for adults.
