For a city more sustainable: A project to clean the air who breathe.

The communitie need to feel clean winds.

The people of my city don´t breathe a pure air because we are living near the industrial pole where they use oil 
and gas and there are some industries more who works there.
The quality of air isn´t very good and always they release a lot of pollution to the atmosphere.
The winds always goes from the sea to the city (from south to north) and sometimes the clouds at night they look 
with a red tone product of the burning.
One day we have had an chlorine clouds wich were of a escape of gas and if the clouds had arrived to the city, we 
would have the fall of acid rain. We have had good luck because the clouds not arrived to the city.
Can´t living with old energies, we need a fast change and now is the moment.
If we continue destroy the planet. we won´t have a future.

So, we need a change of energy matrix and independence of oil.For this we could renew the zone by cleans energies 
like solar energy and tidal power.
Also change the actual cars for electric cars and put a hard penalties for people who polluting.
Other important thing who we should make for the children is give their "green" education.
